## Overview
The Salesforce JIRA Integration project enables seamless synchronization of projects and issues between JIRA and Salesforce. This integration leverages Salesforce Flows, Apex, APIs, and webhooks to ensure real-time data synchronization. It helps teams improve collaboration by consolidating project management data from JIRA into Salesforce custom objects.

## Features

### **1. Synchronization of Projects and Issues**
- Sync JIRA projects to custom objects in Salesforce.
- Sync JIRA issues, including status, priority, and assignees, to Salesforce.
- Bi-directional updates between Salesforce and JIRA.

### **2. Real-Time Updates**
- Webhooks ensure instant updates to Salesforce when changes occur in JIRA.
- Trigger Salesforce workflows or notifications when JIRA data changes.

### **3. Flexible Automation**
- Use Salesforce Flows to configure and automate synchronization logic.
- Customizable data mapping between JIRA fields and Salesforce custom object fields.

### **4. Robust API Integration**
- Leverages JIRA REST APIs for fetching and updating data.
- Apex classes handle API calls and manage error handling for seamless operations.

## Technical Implementation

### **Custom Objects**
- **JIRA Project:** Stores details of JIRA projects, such as name, key, and description.
- **JIRA Issue:** Tracks individual issues with fields such as summary, status, priority, and assignee.

### **Flows**
- Automates the creation and updating of JIRA projects and issues in Salesforce.
- Configurable for custom business requirements, such as specific field mappings.

### **Apex Classes**
- Handles interaction with the JIRA REST API.
- Manages API authentication and data transformation.
- Includes retry logic for failed API requests

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
- A Salesforce org with API access enabled.
- A JIRA instance with REST API permissions.

### Steps
1. **Clone Repository:** Download the project files from GitHub.
2. **Deploy Metadata:** Use Salesforce CLI or an IDE to deploy metadata components to your Salesforce org.
3. **Configure JIRA Webhooks:**
   - In JIRA, create webhooks for the desired events (e.g., issue updates, project changes).
   - Point the webhook URLs to the Salesforce endpoints.
4. **Set Up API Credentials:**
   - Generate API keys or tokens in JIRA for Salesforce to use.
   - Store credentials securely in Salesforce (e.g., Custom Metadata or Named Credentials).
5. **Activate Automations:**
   - Enable relevant Flows and ensure Apex triggers are active.
6. **Test Integration:** Validate synchronization of projects and issues in a sandbox environment.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Fork the repository and create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
